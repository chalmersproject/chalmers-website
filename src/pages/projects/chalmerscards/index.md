Chalmers Cards are wooden information booklets that are designed to be given out at Toronto's emergency shelters and to folks sleeping on the streets of Toronto. They explain how to access social services! Things like toll free numbers for free legal aid and how to apply for financial aid.

Chalmers Cards are laser-cut onto wood so the information doesn't get crumpled. Plus people think they're cool so the cards don't get lost! They also smell nice.

Toronto's social services infrastructure and documentation on social services are complicated.

Even information *intended* to be public facing is often difficult to find in the labryinth like websites of social services like Ontario Works.

During our research and testing we spoke with many folks experiencing homelessness who described themselves as computer illiterate. Many who said they were familiar with computers had their personal computer stolen recently. A lot of social services documentation is available on the internet. But getting on the internet is a real chore when you don't own a computer.

Because information about social services is sparse, it often gets passed around word-of-mouth. Word of mouth can be innacurate and slow, which creates bottlenecks in Toronto's social support infrastructure.

Chalmers Cards are intended to be a to-the-point social services reference guide. Most of it's resources are toll free 24-hour phone numbers. The resources are organized into reasonable categories (health/financial-aid/shelter/legal-aid/general-reference). A workflow for getting financial aid is broken out into a three step process, each with a clear action item. All of this is neatly packaged in a 70mm by 70mm laser-cut wooden booklet that snaps onto your backpack.
